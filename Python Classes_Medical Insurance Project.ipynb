    "### Building our Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you look at script.py, you will see that we have started a class called Patient. It currently has an __init__ method with two class variables: self.name and self.age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by adding in some more patient parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sex: patient’s biological identification, 0 for male and 1 for female\n",
    "- bmi: patient BMI\n",
    "- num_of_children: number of children patient has\n",
    "- smoker: patient smoking status, 0 for a non-smoker and 1 for a smoker\n",
    "\n",
    "Add these into the __init__ method so that we can use them as we create our class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let’s test out our __init__ method and create our first instance variable.\n",
    "Create an instance variable outside of our class called patient1.\n",
    "\n",
    "patient1 = Patient(\"John Doe\", 25, 1, 22.2, 0, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, print out the name of patient1 using the following line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(patient1.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "Print out the rest of patient1’s information to ensure the __init__ method is functioning properly."

    "### Adding Functinality with Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now that our constructor is built out and ready to go, let’s start creating some methods! Our first method will be estimated_insurance_cost(), which takes our instance’s parameters (representing our patient’s information) and returns their expected yearly medical fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the __init__ constructor, define our estimated_insurance_cost() constructor which only takes self as an argument. Inside of this method, add the following formula:\\n\n",
    "estimated\\_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num\\_of\\_children + 24000*smoker - 12500estimated_cost=250∗age−128∗sex+370∗bmi+425∗num_of_children+24000∗smoker−12500\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are using class variables in our formula here, so be sure to remember to use the self keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside of our estimated_insurance_cost() method, let’s add a print statement that displays the following in the terminal:\\n\n",
    "{Patient Name}’s estimated insurance costs is {estimated cost} dollars.\n",
    "Then, test out this method using the patient1 instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We already have one super useful method in our class! Let’s add some more and make our Patient class even more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if our patient recently had a birthday? Or had a fluctuation in weight? Or had a kid? Let’s add some methods that allow us to update these parameters and recalculate the estimated medical fees in one swing.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create an update_age() method. It should take in two arguments: self and new_age. In this method reassign self.age to new_age.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let’s flesh out this method some more!\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a print statement that outputs the following statement in the terminal:\\n\n",
    "{Patient Name} is now {Patient Age} years old.\n",
    "Test out your method using the patient1 instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We also want to see what the new insurance expenses are. Call the estimated_insurance_cost() method in update_age() using this line of code:\\n\n",
    "self.estimated_insurance_cost()\n",
    "Test out your method with patient1.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Let’s make another update method that modifies the num_of_children parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the update_age() method, define a new one called update_num_children(). This method should have two arguments, self and new_num_children. Inside the method, self.num_of_children should be set equal to new_num_children.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Similarly to the method we wrote before, let’s add in a print statement that clarifies the information that is being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update our method to accurately convey when we should use the noun “children” versus when we should use “child”.\n",
    "To do this we can use control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the patient has 1 offspring, we should see the following output:\\n\n",
    "{Patient Name} has {Patient Number of Children} child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we should see this output:\\n\n",
    "{Patient Name} has {Patient Number of Children} children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write out your control flow program, and test it out using patient1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To finish off the update_num_children() method, let’s call our estimated_insurance_cost() method at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use patient1 to ensure that everything is functioning as expected!"

    "### Storing Patient Information\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Let’s create one last method that uses a dictionary to store a patient’s information in one convenient variable. We can use our parameters as the keys and their specific data as the values. Define a method called patient_profile() that builds a dictionary called patient_information to hold all of our patient’s information.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Let’s test out our final method! Use patient1 to call the method patient_profile().\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in patient_profile() we used a return statement rather than a print statement. In order to see our dictionary outputted to the terminal, we must wrap a print statement around our method call. Use patient1 to call the method patient_profile()."
